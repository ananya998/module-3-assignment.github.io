    <p>What Is Risotto?
      Risotto is a traditional Italian rice dish made from a short-grained, starchy variety of rice called arborio rice. A properly cooked risotto should form a soft, creamy mound on a dinner plate. It shouldn't run across the plate, nor should it be stiff or gluey. While not difficult, some essential tips will help you make restaurant-worthy risotto at home.
      
      Risotto Origin:
      The history of risotto is naturally tied to the history of rice in Italy. While there are many conflicting opinions on the historical intricacies, rice was first introduced to Italy and Spain by the Arabs during the Middle Ages.

     The humidity of the Mediterranean was quickly found to be perfect for growing shorter-grained rices, and enormous profits were made by those selling rice in Genoa, Venice and the surrounds.

     The popularity of rice grew through Italy, though primarily among the wealthy owing to the still-exorbitant prices of the product.

     Once the outside world discovered the quality of the Italian product, however, the money poured in and the availability of the short-grains spread, making the rice far more widely accessible.

     It was in Milan where the rice met its delicious destiny. Milan had been under Spanish rule for almost two centuries (hence the similar evolution of paella in Spain), and rice had become a staple. Slow-cooking also dominated the culinary landscape of the region, with Ossobucco a long-held favourite.
      
      How To Make Risotto with a simple Recipe At Home:
      This basic risotto recipe is made with butter, Parmesan cheese, and fresh parsley. It's a perfect recipe to start with if you've never made risotto before. Risotto takes a while to cook properly, and it requires your attention as well as your time. For upwards of 20 minutes, you have one job and one job only: Stir the rice while adding hot stock, a ladleful at a time, and cook the rice slowly so that the stock is absorbed. 


      The technique is called the risotto method. It releases the rice's starches, producing a creamy, velvety dish, and it takes two hands: one for stirring and one for ladling. It's best not to try to multitask while you're doing it. You could probably carry on a conversation, but don't try to do any other kitchen or prep work—especially if you're new to making risotto.


      Risotto is best served warm, often in heated bowls or plates. It can be a side dish to a meat or fish entrée and is often served in restaurants as the first course. Risotto also works as a main when accompanied by a salad or cooked vegetables and
